# Titanic-Survival-Predictor-APP

MIT App Inventor is a cloud-based tool, by which you can build android applications using web browser. This website offers all the support youâ€™ll need to learn how to build your own apps.

It is one of the best ways to create Android apps using Python-flask to Visualise your Machine Learning models.

Here, I cleaned and preprocessed titanic dataset from kaggle and trained my ML Logistic Regression model with the dataset and tried to predict, The accuracy was around 83.14%.

# Working : 
1. After running the .ipynb file, copy the .ngrok.io url, If you give the input to .ngrok.io url and it should display the following output :

2. Open MIT App inveter website, Create an account and import the .aia file.

3. After importing there will be 2 sections :  Blocks(for adding Fuctionality to components) and Designer(Drag and drop UI for components)

4. Paste the .ngrok.io url to Url block, as shown above.

5. The last step is to install MIT app inventer on your device and click on add AI companian from website.
